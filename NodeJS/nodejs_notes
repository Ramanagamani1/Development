Nodejs runs outside of the browser.

It uses Google Javascript V8 engine.

It does not have access to window,document objects. setTimeOut function,Math is present in window objects, so we cannot access them with window object. window is a way to access browser window and has a global scope and is the outer most object

But, nodejs has an object called global by which we can use the setTimeOut,Math functions
process is not accessible in js from client side but its accessible from server side

Express js is the most popular library to create servers
